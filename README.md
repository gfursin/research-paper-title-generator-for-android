Academic researchers are often forced to write as many publications as possible
instead of focusing on quality, public availability and reproducibility of their results.

Hence, to help our fellow researchers, we created this application to automatically
generate titles for research papers in computer engineering.

It demonstrates how to use our Java-based OpenME interface to connect to 
CK (Collective Knowledge) web services with JSON API to generate and
return paper title.

You can import, build and run it to Android Studio or install it 
on your Android-device from Google Play Store:

Alternatively, you may be interested to check out our long-term initiatives to
enable collaborative, systematic and reproducible research and experimentation (
focusing on computer engineering):

* New publication model with community-driven reviewing of papers and artifacts:

 > http://adapt-workshop.org

 > http://ctuning.org/cm/wiki/index.php?title=Reproducibility

* Artifact evaluation for conference and journals (sharing and validating code and data along with publications):

 > http://ctuning.org/event/ae-ppopp2015

 > http://ctuning.org/event/ae-cgo2015

* Open SDK for collaborative and interactive experimentation:
